AstroVision is an AI-driven orbital analytics and visualization system that predicts potential satellite collision risks based on orbital parameters such as altitude, inclination, and radiation intensity. It blends machine learning, agentic AI, and data visualization to help researchers, engineers, and space agencies make smarter, data-backed space operation decisions.

🚀 Problem Statement

With over 10,000 active satellites and millions of space debris fragments orbiting Earth, predicting and preventing collisions has become critical.
Existing systems are often inaccessible or lack real-time visualization capabilities.
AstroVision aims to provide a fast, intuitive, and intelligent platform that visualizes orbital stability and predicts risk using AI-powered insights.
